            Citing is the process of acknowledging the sources of information, ideas, or words that you use in your writing, and it serves to give credit to original authors, strengthen your arguments with evidence, and help readers locate the materials you consulted. Although the purpose of citation is consistent across academic fields, different citation styles format these acknowledgments in distinct ways. **APA style**, commonly used in the social sciences, employs an author–date system in which in-text citations include the author’s last name and year of publication—for example, *(Smith, 2020)*—and full references appear at the end of the paper in a standardized format. **MLA style**, widely used in the humanities, favors an author–page system, citing sources in the text with the author’s last name and the page number, such as *(Smith 15)*, and listing complete publication details on a Works Cited page. **Harvard style**, also an author–date system similar to APA, uses in-text citations like *(Smith 2020)* but often follows slightly different conventions for punctuation and reference-list formatting, depending on the institution or publisher's guidelines. Overall, citing ensures academic integrity, prevents plagiarism, and allows readers to trace the development of your ideas by examining the original sources you consulted.
