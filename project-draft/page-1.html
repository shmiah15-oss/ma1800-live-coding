    <h1>A guide for you!</h1>

    <p>You wanted a guide right? This sure is one, I'm here to help. What type of help do you want? You want to know how to watch videos, how to search, how to turn off the ai features? Why do you need help in the first place, its easy to use - just learn. Did you know that not being able to navigate the internet is a pretty big flaw these days - it's a basic necessity! I'm sure you can figure it out, just try.....you can't?....how lame. </p>

    <p>Oh sorry that was kind of mean huh?, it's the truth though</p>
