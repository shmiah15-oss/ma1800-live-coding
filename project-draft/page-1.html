        <h1>A guide for you!</h1>

        <div id="article">
            <p>You wanted a guide right? This sure is one, I'm here to help. What type of help do you want? You want to 
            know how to watch videos, how to search, how to turn off the ai features? Why do you need help in the 
            first place, its easy to use - just learn. Did you know that not being able to navigate the web is a 
            pretty big flaw these days - it's a basic necessity! Like you need to be able to research things for 
            assignments or for wanting to play mini games or something. Google is bascially global at this point, 
            I dont get how you don't know this stuff, I'm sure you can figure it out, just try.....you can't?....
            <strong>how lame.</strong> Oh sorry that was kind of mean huh?, it's the truth though. Fine whatever. You see the section 
            you can type into? yea thats the search bar - just type in your question or a random word (anything really), 
            then press the space bar or click the search icon and you're good.  </p>
