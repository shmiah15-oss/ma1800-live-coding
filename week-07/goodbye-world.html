  During the 1960s and 1970s, Nelson developed his ideas on hypertext in more depth. 
  His vision was not just about linking documents, but about creating a vast, 
  interconnected library where readers and writers could share knowledge seamlessly. 
  Unlike the modern web, Nelson imagined a system where credit and payment could flow 
  back to authors every time their work was reused.

  In 1974, Nelson published <i>Computer Lib / Dream Machines</i>, a book that became 
  a countercultural classic. It urged people to take control of computers rather than 
  accept them as tools of corporate or government power. His ideas in these works, 
  including the founding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" target="_blank">Project Xanadu</a> (founded 1960) and the publication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines" target="_blank">Computer Lib / Dream Machines</a> in 1974, were hugely influential in shaping how we think about the web today.
